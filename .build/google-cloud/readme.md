# Google Cloud Deployment

The cloud builder files are inspired by https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community/tree/master/packer/examples/gce

Basically for building simply run `gcloud builds submit .` in this folder (if you are already logged in with gcloud cli). Otherwise have a look at the build-vm.sh script in this folder.
